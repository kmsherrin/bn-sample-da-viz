# Kendalls notes:
I quickly bootstrapped this project with CRA (create react app, see below). This wasn't entirely necessary,
especially given the complexity of the project, but I did it anyways...

To run this app (just in dev mode), make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed, [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Open the project root directory in your terminal, i.e. the folder which has the package.json, App.js etc. You will then need to run:
`
npm install
`

The command will install all the necessary packages, it make take a short time.

### Please note:
Before starting, set a system environment variable REACT_APP_BN_API_URL to the address of the sample data.
On windows this looks like set REACT_APP_BN_API_URL=https://website.address
On Unix this looks like export REACT_APP_BN_API_URL=https://website.address

If that fails, please go to line 55 in App.js and set the url to the sample data address.


To start the development server (because it is a web app), run from the same terminal as before:
`
npm start
`

The server should then start up and automatically direct your browser to the page. If not, check the terminal where it is running and it will tell you the address to navigate to. Most likely, this is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


If you want some tests were written tp mildly verify some things are working. Run these with:
`
npm test
`
All tests should pass if everything is setup correctly

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
